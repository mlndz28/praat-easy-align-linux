 Segmentation type: syll-nucl
 Time:  
     total speech time=20.71(s) [Note 1]
     estimated phonation time=13.38 (64.60% of speech time) [Note 2]
     estimated pause time=7.33 (35.40% of speech time) [Note 3]
 Nucleus: 86 nuclei in signal
 Nucleus duration: 
     mean=0.076(s) stdev=0.042 summed nucleus duration=6.53 (s)
 Global pitch measures for stylized nuclei: 
     min=90.00(Hz), max=335.02(Hz), mean of median=228.84 [Note 7]
     quantiles (for median pitch values) 2%=160.28(Hz), 5%=173.23(Hz), 95%=291.84(Hz), 98%=326.11(Hz) 
 Intrasyllabic pitch interval: 
     dynamic=10.47%, of which: rising=44.44%, falling=55.56% [Note 4]
     mean=-0.67(ST) stdev=1.99
     sum=-57.82(ST) sum/nucleus_time=-8.85(ST/s) [Note 5]
     trajectory=152.52(ST) trajectory/nucleus_time=23.36(ST/s) [Note 6]
 Intersyllabic pitch interval: 
     mean=-0.01(ST) stdev=3.51
     sum=-0.67(ST) sum/inter_nucleus_time=-8.85(ST/s) [Note 5]
     trajectory=218.94(ST) trajectory/inter_nucleus_time=31.98(ST/s) [Note 6]
 All pitch intervals: 
     trajectory(speech)=371.46(ST) [Note 1,2,6]
     trajectory(speech)/speech_time=17.94(ST/s)
     trajectory(phonation)/phonation_time=22.90(ST/s)

 Notes 
  [1] speech time = internucleus time + intranucleus time + pause time 
  [2] phonation time = internucleus time + intranucleus time 
  [3] estimated pause = when internucleus time >= 0.3
  [4] dynamic = when pitch variation exceeds glissando threshold
      rising = when sum of upward intervals > sum of abs(downward intervals)
  [5] sum = sum of signed pitch intervals (falls and rises compensate)
  [6] trajectory = sum of absolute pitch intervals (falls and rises add up)
  [7] mean of median = mean of median pitch of all nuclei
